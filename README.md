Simple projects on PIC16F887 microcontroller.

### Apparatus/Software applications: 
---
- [MPLAB X IDE v5.35](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tools-tools-and-software/mplab-x-ide)
- [SimulIDE_0.4.13-SR5](https://www.simulide.com/p/home.html)
- [SimulIDE_0.4.14-SR5](https://www.simulide.com/p/home.html)

### File Description:
---
- proj001pic16f887: Individual project.
- proj001pic16f887.X: Project folder generated from MPLAB X IDE (which is loaded to the controller during simulation in simulIDE).
- proj001pic16f887.simu: Project file generated in SimulIDE where circuit simulation is observed.
- proj001pic16f887.png: Circuit diagram Image extracted from SimulIDE.


**NOTE:** Choose the properties of the controller inside SimulIDE (during simulation) carefully according to the cofiguration made in respective program (especially the clock).

---
**[proj001pic16f887](proj001pic16f887)**: To make an LED blink at regular interval.

---
**[proj002pic16f887](proj002pic16f887)**: To make an LED glow as long as the switch is closed.

---
**[proj003pic16f887](proj003pic16f887)**: Glow LED for certain amount of time when switch close is detected.

---
**[proj004pic16f887](proj004pic16f887)**: Interface four 7-segment LEDs with PIC16F887 and display a four digit number (Display 4-digit integer number using the multiplexed 7-segment display interface).

---
**[proj005pic16f887](proj005pic16f887)**: Interface of PIC16F887 with 16x2 Character matrix 5x8 dot matrix LCD.

---
**[proj006pic16f887](proj006pic16f887)**: To demonstrate Analog to Digital Conversion using internal ADC module of PIC16F887.

---
**[proj007pic16f887](proj007pic16f887)**: To demonstrate A/D Conversion using internal ADC module of PIC16F887 output the ADC value with corresponding voltage value.

---
**[proj008pic16f887](proj008pic16f887)**: To demonstrate production of PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal of particualar frequency and varying its On-time (duty-cycle) with regular delays using Timer0 of the controller and internal clock as the source for the timer0.

---
**[proj009pic16f887](proj009pic16f887)**: To demonstrate Pulse Width Modulation. Duty cycle of the output signal is controlled using ADC and TIMER0 of the controller.

---
**[proj010pic16f887](proj010pic16f887)**: To interface a stepper motor and rotate stepper motor in clockwise or anticlockwise with speed control.
